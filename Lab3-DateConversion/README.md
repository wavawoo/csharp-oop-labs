# Lab 3: Language Constructs

## Overview
A comprehensive date conversion program that demonstrates the evolution of C# language constructs through three progressive exercises. The system transforms day-of-year numbers into human-readable month-day pairs, showcasing fundamental programming concepts from basic logic to robust error handling.

## Exercise 1: Basic Date Conversion
- Convert day number (1-365) to month-day pair
- Use if/switch → enum → foreach progression
- Arrays for days in months

## Exercise 2: Exception Handling  
- Add try-catch blocks
- Validate input range
- Throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException

## Exercise 3: Leap Year Support
- Input year and detect leap years
- Handle 366 days in leap years
- Different days arrays for leap/non-leap years
