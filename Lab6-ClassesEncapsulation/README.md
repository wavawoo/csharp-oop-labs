# Lab 6: Classes and Encapsulation in C#

## Overview
A progressive laboratory work demonstrating object-oriented programming principles through the evolution of a BankAccount class. Focuses on encapsulation, static members, and class methods.

### Exercise 1: Basic Class with Encapsulation
- **Struct to Class conversion**: Understanding value vs reference types
- **Private fields**: Data hiding and encapsulation
- **Public methods**: Controlled access through methods
- **Constructor pattern**: Using Populate method for initialization

### Exercise 2: Static Members and Auto-numbering
- **Static fields**: Shared data across instances
- **Auto-numbering**: Automatic account number generation
- **Method access control**: Private static methods
- **Simplified interface**: Reduced parameter requirements

### Exercise 3: Business Logic Methods
- **Deposit operations**: Adding funds to accounts
- **Withdrawal operations**: Removing funds with validation
- **Boolean returns**: Success/failure status for operations
- **Complete banking interface**: Full account management
